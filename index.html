                            The Wolfram Language allows programmers to operate at a significantly
                            higher level than ever before, by leveraging built-in computational
                            intelligence <br> that relies on a vast depth of algorithms and real-world
                            knowledge carefully integrated over three decades. Scalable for programs
                            from tiny to huge, <br> with immediate deployment locally and in the cloud, the
                            Wolfram Language builds on clear principles—and an elegant unified symbolic
                            structure—to create <br> what is emerging as the world's most productive programming
                            language and the first true computational communication language for humans and AIs.

                        <h4>MobileNet: Convolutional Neural Networks</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            MobileNet is a class of efficient models called MobileNets
                            for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are
                            based on a streamlined architecture <br> that uses depth-wise separable
                            convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two
                            simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently <br> trade off between latency and
                            accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized
                            model for their application based on the <br> constraints of the problem. We present 
                            xtensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance
                            compared to other popular <br> models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the 
                            effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including
                            object <br> detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.
